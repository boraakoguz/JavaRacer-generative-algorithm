1. create a population with rand properties +
2. iterate over number of generations
3. calculate fitness of each agent (points) +
4. in the fitness array get the (elitism_number) of agents starting from the best. +
5. calculate probability values of the array using softmax  +
6. using the above weights, get randomly chosen pairs from the array and append to a parents_list where each element contains 2 agents +
7. iterate over population and create childs of these parents using crossover. +
8. use random to determine whether to mutate or not+
9. directly append elite agents
10. set population to new population and continue+
